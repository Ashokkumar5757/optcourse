        >>>MySQL is a relational database management system
        The database structure is organized into physical files optimized for speed. The logical data model, with objects such as data tables, views, rows, and columns, offers a flexible programming environment.It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of information in a corporate network. To add, access, and process data stored in a computer database, you need a database management system such as MySQL Server.MySQL is an Oracle-backed open source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL). MySQL runs on virtually all platforms, including Linux, UNIX and Windows.MySQL is used to manage the data of web applications, websites, and even mobile applications by sorting it into tables; because of this, it is called a relational database. This popular database management system uses SQL query language to retrieve or modify the information of the database.A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big storeroom. The database structures are organized into physical files optimized for speed.MySQL has all essential SQL numeric data types. These data types can include the exact numeric data types (For example, integer, decimal, numeric, etc.), as well as the approximate numeric data types (For example, float, real, and double precision). It also supports BIT datatype to store bit values.SQL and MySQL are database-related languages. While SQL is a programming language used to work with data in relational databases, MySQL is an open-source database product that implements the SQL standard.

While SQL is a programming language used to work with data in relational databases, MySQL is an open-source database product that implements the SQL standard.MySQL is an open source relational database management system. For WordPress sites, that means it helps you store all your blog posts, users, plugin information, etc. It stores that information in separate “tables” and connects it with “keys”, which is why it's relational.MySQL tops the list of robust transactional database engines available on the market. With features such as complete atomic, consistent, isolated, durable transaction support; multi-version transaction support; and unrestricted row-level locking, it is the go-to solution for full data integrity.The 5 keys supported by MySQL are Primary Key, Unique Key, Candidate Key, Foreign Key, and Super Key. You learned how to create a table to define and also how to alter the table for primary and unique keys.
