        >>>MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.MongoDB is a scalable, flexible NoSQL document database platform designed to overcome the relational databases approach and the limitations of other NoSQL solutions.MongoDB is designed to make data easy to access, and rarely to require joins or transactions, but when you need to do complex querying, it's more than up to the task. The MongoDB Query API allows you to query deep into documents, and even perform complex analytics pipelines with just a few lines of declarative code.MongoDB stores data in RAM for faster data access and greater performance when executing queries. It collects data directly from RAM rather than the hard disk, making data reads and writes faster.

>>>A MongoDB Function can be used to read, insert, update, or delete data from your MongoDB database. When you connect your database to Internal, basic functions corresponding to each collection in your database are automatically generated for you.MongoDB uses the MongoDB Query Language (MQL), designed for easy use by developers. The documentation compares MQL and SQL syntax for common database operations.MongoDB is a NoSQL distributed database program. Because data doesn't need to fit within the confines of a strict relationship, MongoDB can operate as a general data store. This database provides several advantages. In this type of database, data is stored in MongoDB and maps to a flexible schema.MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.The tools are MongoDB Compass, MongoDB Connector, MongoDB Charts, MongoDB Studio 3T, NoSQL Booster, Mongo Management Studio, MongoJS Query Analyzer, and Nucleon Database Master.The maximum BSON document size is 16 megabytes. The maximum document size helps ensure that a single document cannot use excessive amount of RAM or, during transmission, excessive amount of bandwidth. To store documents larger than the maximum size, MongoDB provides the GridFS API.
